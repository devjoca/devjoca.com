Since the last year I was trying to put some effort on a side project in order to learn some amazing new technologies or just for fun.
There are a lot of complicated things about side projects, but for me was to actually start something so I choose building my personal blog to fill that purpose.

## The Stack üèó

I like to consider me as a backend developer, however as most of us, sometimes we had to interact with some UI and one on the first technologies I learned after jQuery was VueJS. Time ago, with my experience on Vue, I pick Nuxt.js to develop a very simple landing website and it was really fun and a nice experience.

For the moment, I want to try a new experience and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) could really fulfill this purpose, in terms of a Backend for that content I want to try using [dev.to](https://dev.to/) API, so the content in my blog could be in 2 places at the same time. I'm actually not sure about this approach, but let's see how it goes.

## Motivation üî•

I'm really passionate about sharing things and knowledge, usually, I share links with my friends or coworkers in our Slack and then save in [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/a/), but now I want to go one step further writing a little review as an entry post. This idea was heavily inspire in the [Freek Van der Herten‚Äôs blog](https://freek.dev/). I really admire this guy from the Laravel community, for example he suggetst to blog about things we learned, so I'm taking this approach for now and beyond.

Lastly and not less important, improving my writing English was my other motivation, I hope this project is going to help me on that side. I‚Äôm very proud to finally lunch my blog. :)
