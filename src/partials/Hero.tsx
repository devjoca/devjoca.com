          <p>A Peru-based software engineer.</p>
          Began as a PHP developer, learned about Python frameworks, and now the
          majority of my projects are built using Node.js and TypeScript. I'd
          really like to call myself a backend engineer and also curious about
          other cutting-edge technologies that are entering the market, like
          AI/M.
